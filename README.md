### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack LAMP dev of 2+ years with a passion for service. My work in the clean water industry has taken me from the United States to Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and beyond. 

Besides LAMP and Python development, I teach US marching bands at the high school and collegiate level, and I'm a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blue belt. I'm one of those guys who knows a little bit about a whole lot of things.

## Currently looking for another role as a developer! Feel free to reach me at <ins>erickrj003@gmail.com</ins>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Today's Worldwide Rock, a Python-based Twitter Bot that tweets about rock songs from various countries around the globe.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (trying to) learning Vue.js!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on PHP or Python projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a billion hobbies :D Ask me about BJJ, Judo, Magic: The Gathering, Drum Corps, MMA, the White Sox...
