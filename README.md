### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack LAMP dev of 2+ years with a passion for service. My work in the clean water industry has taken me from the United States to Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and beyond. 
At the end of the day though, people are so much more important than machines. My greatest work comes from passionately supporting full-stack projects that directly change lives.
